# Bloomreach SAP Spartacus Integration

This is the repository containing the code for the Bloomreach Spartacus SAP Commerce Cloud integration. The repository
is similar to the [Cloud Commerce Sample Setup repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-commerce-sample-setup),
the 3 root folders within contain:

- The Angular library that integrations a Spartacus storefront with the Bloomreach Content SaaS platform and its preview
  functionality using the Experience Manager
- An example Spartacus storefront application utilizing the `@bloomreach/brx-spartacus-integration` library to integrate
  with Bloomreach Content SaaS
- A set of configuration files deployed to SAP to configure the API for the example application

There is a Channel template available featuring a full integration with SAP Commerce Cloud and Bloomreach Content &
Search & Merchandising in a provisioned instance of Bloomreach Content SaaS. 

## Development

Instructions for developing the library and storefront are in their respective README's.
